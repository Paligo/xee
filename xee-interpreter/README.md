# xee-interpreter

`xee-interpreter` provides the runtime to run Xee code. It includes a
bytecode interpreter, an implementation of XPath data types, and the XPath
standard library.

It is a low-level component, and is used by `xee-xpath` to implement XPath and
can also serve as the engine to execute XSLT code (work in progress).
