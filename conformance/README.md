# XPath Conformance

The true level of XPath conformance is validated using the qt3 test suite, but
this test suite presents a chicken and egg problem: in order to run many of the
tests that test a particular feature, a lot of other XPath functionality
already has to work. These document take another perspective. We go through the
XPath 3.1 specifications and discuss section by section what we think we have
implemented already. This gives us a measure of progress.
